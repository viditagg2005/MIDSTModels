    "# ClavaDDPM: Multi-relational Data Synthesis with Cluster-guided Diffusion Models for the White Box MIA Competiton (DEV and FINAL Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent tabular data synthesis research has focused on single tables, while real-world applications often involve complex, interconnected tables. Existing methods for multi-relational data synthesis struggle with scalability and long-range dependencies. This paper introduces Cluster Latent Variable guided Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (ClavaDDPM), using clustering labels to model inter-table relationships, particularly foreign key constraints. ClavaDDPM efficiently propagates latent variables across tables, capturing long-range dependencies. Evaluations show ClavaDDPM outperforms existing methods on multi-table data and remains competitive for single-table data.\n",

We run the clustering algorithm below to preprocess the data for training the ClavaDDPM model. Additionally, we empirically determine the distribution of table sizes in the dataset, which will be used in the later sampling process.\n",
